# odin-library

In this project, I will be creating a 'library' of books.
It will include a simple form, with a few text inputs, for:
<ol>
  <li>Book Title
  <li>Author
  <li>Page Count
</ol>

And a checkbox for whether the user has read the book yet or not.

All of these objects will be stored within an array.
The array will then be looped through, and all information will be put
on the webpage as a 'library'.
